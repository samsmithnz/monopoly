# Monopoly - The Classic Board Game

Welcome to the Monopoly game implemented in JavaScript! This version of the classic economics-themed board game allows players to experience the thrill of rolling two dice, moving around the game board, buying and trading properties, and developing them with houses and hotels. Players can collect rent from their opponents, aiming to drive them into bankruptcy. Additionally, the game features Chance and Community Chest cards, tax squares, salary for passing "Go", and jail conditions, providing a comprehensive Monopoly experience.

## How to Play

1. **Starting the Game**: Each player rolls two dice, and the highest roller starts the game.
2. **Rolling the Dice**: On your turn, roll two dice and move your piece around the board accordingly.
3. **Buying Properties**: When you land on an unowned property, you may buy it from the bank at its printed price. If you choose not to buy, the property is auctioned to the highest bidder.
4. **Paying Rent**: If you land on a property owned by another player, you must pay them rent according to the property's rent value.
5. **Developing Properties**: Once you own all properties of the same color, you can start building houses and hotels to increase rent.
6. **Chance and Community Chest Cards**: Landing on these spaces will give you a card that could benefit or penalize you.
7. **Tax Squares**: Landing on a tax square requires you to pay the specified amount to the bank.
8. **Going to Jail**: You can end up in jail through certain game cards or by rolling doubles three times in a row. You cannot move until you have met one of three conditions for release.
9. **Passing 'Go'**: Each time you pass "Go", you collect a salary of $200.

Enjoy the game and may the best strategist win!
