# Monopoly Game Rules

## Introduction
Monopoly is a classic board game where players roll two six-sided dice to move around the game board, buying and trading properties, and developing them with houses and hotels. Players collect rent from their opponents, with the goal being to drive them into bankruptcy. Money can also be gained or lost through Chance and Community Chest cards, tax squares, players receive a salary every time they pass "Go", and players can end up in jail.

## Starting the Game
- Each player chooses a token and places it on "Go".
- Players roll two dice to determine the order of play; the highest roll goes first.

## Rolling the Dice
- On your turn, roll both dice and move your token clockwise around the board the number of spaces equal to the sum of the dice.
- If you roll doubles, you take another turn after completing your current turn. Rolling doubles three times in a row, however, lands you in jail.

## Buying Properties
- When you land on an unowned property, you may buy it at the price listed on the board. If you choose not to buy, the property is auctioned to the highest bidder.
- Properties are color-coded groups. Owning all properties in a color group allows you to build houses and hotels.

## Paying Rent
- Landing on a property owned by another player requires you to pay rent. The rent amount is specified on the property's deed card.
- Rent increases if the owner has a complete color group or has built houses or hotels on their properties.

## Chance and Community Chest
- Landing on a Chance or Community Chest space requires you to draw a card from the respective deck. These cards can benefit or penalize you.

## Tax Squares
- Landing on an Income Tax or Luxury Tax square requires you to pay the specified amount to the bank.

## Going to Jail
- You can be sent to jail if you land on the "Go to Jail" space, draw a card that sends you to jail, or roll doubles three times in a row.
- While in jail, you can't move until you roll doubles, pay a $50 fine, or use a "Get Out of Jail Free" card.

## Passing 'Go'
- Each time you pass "Go", you collect $200 from the bank.

## Winning the Game
- The game continues until all but one player has gone bankrupt. The last player remaining is the winner.

Enjoy the game, and may the best strategist win!
